# GitThemes
I have been using posh git and o my posh for a while. But I was facing some symbol and character  problems. I have made a customized theme for my own. 
# demo:
<img src= "/fig/git" theme demo.jpg>

# How to use?
1. you will need to install <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases">cascadia fonts</a> for this theme.
2. just paste it in you posh themes folder:
"C:\Users\----\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\oh-my-posh\posh_version\themes"
